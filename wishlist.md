# Aaron Wishlist

This is my canonical birthday, Christmas, and any-other-time wish list. **It is up to date as of {{ site.time | date: '%B %-d, %Y' }}.**

<details markdown="1">
<summary markdown="1">
## Skip Amazon
</summary>

I dislike Amazon since they’re extremely [anti-competitive](https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox) and [awful to their workers](https://gizmodo.com/reminder-amazon-treats-its-employees-like-shit-1792642652). So if you can, please purchase any items here somewhere other than Amazon.

**Buying from the company who makes the thing is usually best**, but I also recommend the following stores:
- [Target](https://target.com) - Their online shopping is great, plus there's the convenience of picking up in store skipping shipping costs.
- [Micro Center](https://microcenter.com) - They usually have all the Raspberry Pi stuff and lots of other electronics and accessories.
- [Best Buy](https://bestbuy.com) - Pretty competitive for most electronics, aside from cheaper things like small accessories. In-store pickup is great.
- [Google Shopping](https://shopping.google.com/) - Huge selection since they partner with _a ton_ of large and small retailers like Target, Best Buy, Costco, Fry's, Home Depot, etc. However, they changed it recently and it's a little harder to use.
