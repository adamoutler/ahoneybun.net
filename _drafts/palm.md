# I used the Palm Phone for a Week

It reinvigorated my want for small phones, even if this one ain't it

I'm a fan of small phones, and think every modern Android flagship is too damn big. People kept pointing out the Palm phone as something I'd probably like, so I finally decided to bite the bullet and give it a try as my main phone, against [Ryan's recommendation](https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/11/17/palm-phone-review-tiny-tragedy/). Luckily, since the phone seems to have largely been a flop and is a few years old at this point, I was able to score one on eBay for under $70—close enough to impulse purchase territory for me to justify grabbing it.

In a nutshell, I don't regret it at that price, but I also don't recommend anyone follow my lead.


I had seen the Palm phone in person in Verizon stores when it first came out, but I had forgotten just how absolutely tiny it actually is. I've been using a Pixel 5 since it was released, and have been shouting about how it's not a small phone, but the Palm phone makes the Pixel 5 seem absolutely gargantuan.

## Flipping the script

For my experiment, I decided I'd flip the script on the original "companion" design of the phone, instead using it as my main phone with my Pixel 5 acting as backup/companion for its big battery, good camera, and large screen that is better for productivity. I'm on Google Fi, so I was unable to use Verizon's carrier-level call and messaging sharing between the phones, but I was able to pop my primary SIM into the Palm phone while keeping a data SIM in the Pixel 5. I pinned Google Messages' web app to the home screen on the Pixel, and just gave up taking rare "real" calls on it.

Messaging was where things first started to fall apart for me on the Palm phone. With its abysmally tiny battery, the phone doesn't last all day even with minimal screen and app use; just powering the cellular and Wi-Fi radios alone eats through the battery in a matter of hours. Knowing this, Palm aggressively pushes you to use "Life Mode" which is little more than telling the radios to power down when the screen is off. If it's a companion phone, your messages would still come through to your main phone and would sync back up when you power on. However, when using the Palm as a main phone, it means SMS and MMS messages get jammed up in transit and are often delivered out of order. This is especially true with group MMS messages, where they seem to get stuck as a new MMS to be downloaded associated with the sender, and then later appear in the group conversation in the order that they were downloaded—not the order in which they were sent. Turning the radios off when in standby also means the Google Messages web app is useless; it can't connect, and thus you can't read or send messages from another device unless the Palm phone is being used in the first place.

If you're a Google Fi user who doesn't care about RCS, you can enable Fi integration with Google Messages, which I believe would resolve this issue and make your messages available from multiple devices regardless of the state of the Palm phone. This can also be worked around if you use Google Voice or another a third-party chat service that supports multiple devices. But I'm in multiple long-standing RCS Chat conversations, and don't want to give those up just for a week's experiment—so I suffered.
