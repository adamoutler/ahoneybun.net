> *NOTE:* I've had the PinePhone for about 1 year though it has never been my daily driver. It has been running [Arch Linux ARM (ALARM)](https://github.com/dreemurrs-embedded/Pine64-Arch) most of that time though I have used [postmarketOS](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/PINE64_PinePhone_(pine64-pinephone)), [Mobian](https://wiki.mobian-project.org/doku.php?id=pinephone) and [Manjaro](https://forum.manjaro.org/t/manjaro-arm-beta13-with-phosh-pinephone/79665) a few different times.

## What I use my current Smart Phone for

- Calls (very limited)
- Texts (with photos and other information)
- Messaging applications like
    - Slack (work)
    - Telegram
    - Discord
- Navigation
- Internet browsing
    - YouTube
    - Search terms
- Taking photos and videos

### What it needs

- USB Type-C

### Bonus Features

- Open Source (big big bonus!)
- Linux kernel (won't have to worry about updates as long as the community works on it)
- USB Type-C (with video out)

### Missing Feature

- Navigation [1]

[1] There is recent work on fixing GPS issues but I haven't found a good application to use [OpenStreetMap](openstreetmap.org/) since GNOME Maps doesn't fit the device screen correctly yet.
