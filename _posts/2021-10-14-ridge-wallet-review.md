> *NOTE:* I bought this wallet with my own money and Ridge had no involvement with this review at all.

## Some Background

I've used a few minimalist wallets which mostly started with [Dash Wallets](https://dashwallets.com/) with the [Slim Elastic Wallet 2.0](https://dashwallets.com/collections/shop/products/black-dash-2-0) then I moved to the [Slim Wallet 3.0](https://dashwallets.com/collections/shop/products/3-0-saffiano-slim-wallet-black) which was my go to for a few years. After some time I moved to the Simple Bank's leather wallet which was made by [Tanner Goods](https://www.tannergoods.com/) which has my go to since I got it a year or so ago. With the sad passing of Simple I've been looking for a replacement which wouldn't be made of leather and instead of a form of metal.

### Ridge Wallet

Since I got some ads on my social media feeds I've been looking at their wallets but I couldn't pull the trigger until recently since the base price is $85 USD while the Dash Wallets are around $20-$30 USD and the Simple wallet was free. I picked the "basic" version which is the [Aluminum Gunmetal version](https://ridge.com/collections/wallets/products/aluminum-gunmetal) and here is my review after having it and using it for about two weeks.

### Review

- Pros
    - RFID blocking
    - Compact 
    - Metal build
    - Not leather

- Cons
    - Pricey for most people
    - RFID blocking (I'll cover this in the paper cuts section)
    - Tough to use (in the way that the ads and videos show anyway)

### Paper Cuts

- Kinda tough to get the cards out though this might change as the strap wears out a bit. 
- Not good for if you have an HID card used for doors and other places. I keep mine in my pocket with the wallet though I may put it on my lanyard with my keys. 

### Should you get this?

If you match up with my needs or are pretty similar then yes! One of the big tips that I can give which I believe Ridge give as well is to put your top two cards on the top and bottom of the stack.
