> *NOTE:* I bought this wallet with my own money and Ridge had no involvement with this review at all.

## Some Background

I've used a few minimalist wallets which mostly started with [Dash Wallets](https://dashwallets.com/) with the [Slim Elastic Wallet 2.0](https://dashwallets.com/collections/shop/products/black-dash-2-0) then I moved to the [Slim Wallet 3.0](https://dashwallets.com/collections/shop/products/3-0-saffiano-slim-wallet-black) which was my go to for a few years. After some time I moved to the Simple Bank's leather wallet which was made by [Tanner Goods](https://www.tannergoods.com/) which has my go to since I got it a year or so ago. With the sad passing of Simple I've been looking for a replacement which wouldn't be made of leather and instead of a form of metal.

### Ridge Wallet

Since I got some ads on my social media feeds I've been looking at their wallets but I couldn't pull the trigger until recently since the base price is $85 USD while the Dash Wallets are around $20-$30 USD and the Simple wallet was free.
