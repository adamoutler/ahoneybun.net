## Terms

- [JumpDrive](https://github.com/dreemurrs-embedded/Jumpdrive)

JumpDrive is software used to boot the PinePhone so that the onboard eMMC can be written to for replacing the currently installed OS. 

- [eMMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MultiMediaCard#eMMC)

This is the onboard storage used for most Smartphones and Tablets (like the PinePhone and the PineTab)

- [MMC (microSD/SD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SD_card)

This is a storage device used to store data and in this case an OS. 

> *NOTE:* eMMC storage will be noticeably faster when compared to a microSD card.
