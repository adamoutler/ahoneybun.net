## About me and my Linux journey

I've been using Linux as a desktop OS since around 10 with Ubuntu 10.10. I've mostly stuck with the default layout that Ubuntu uses when it comes to the partition layout:

- UEFI (BIOS before I had UEFI hardware)
- Root
- Swap

I've messed with having a separate /home partition before but as I pretty much stayed with the Ubuntu based OSes for a while I didn't see the need anymore. Any benefit that you get from it can be done with having good backups with tools like [Deja Dup](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.gnome.DejaDup) or [Pika Backup](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.gnome.World.PikaBackup) anyway. 

### My System76 journey

When I started at System76 I was just using Linux (Ubuntu mainly but some Arch) as an OS like pretty much everyone else would:

- Browsing the web
- Writing/Read documents 
- Senting and receiving emails

Outside of the *normal* users I would game and some times write code. Now pay attention to the italicized word there as what *advanced* users would label as *normal* users is very different then they would label themselves as. 

## Opposing views

After about four years under my belt I've begun seeing Desktop Linux a bit differently. I've used to view my desktop and time as endless as in it doesn't matter if my desktop is broken I would have the time to set it all up again. I've grown tired of that mindset and the work that goes along with it. 

I now understand the pain points of the ground felling apart under your feet and I'm excited about the technology being used to start that from happening.
