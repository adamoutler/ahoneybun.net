# Aaron's Desk

I was working 100% from home. As such, I’ve built myself a nice little workspace centered around a nice big motorized sit/stand desk.

It’s gone through some revisions due to rearranging our home; here is what currently makes it up, as well as a historical log of past iterations.

## Desk Itself

- IKEA tabletop 
- [Autonomous SmartDesk](https://bit.ly/2AHm3HE) DIY kit, dual motor, white
- 1× cable management basket (underneath)
- Random power strip with long cord, attached to desk with 3M Command Velcro to keep only one cord going from desk to wall

## Workstation/Gear

- 34&Prime; 3440x1440 Alienware UltraWide display
- Custom Build Desktop
